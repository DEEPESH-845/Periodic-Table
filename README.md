### Hover Effects

When users hover over a tile, the following detailed information will be displayed in a tooltip:

- **Atomic Number:** The number of protons in the nucleus of the atom.
- **Symbol:** The one or two-letter abbreviation of the element.
- **Atomic Mass:** The weighted average mass of the element's isotopes.
- **Electron Configuration:** The distribution of electrons in the atom's orbitals.


## Conclusion

This interactive 3D visualization of the periodic table aims to provide an engaging and informative experience for users. By incorporating color-coded tiles, hover effects, and detailed information, the tool will serve as an educational resource that enhances the understanding of chemical elements and their properties. The design will ensure clarity and usability, making it suitable for a wide range of audiences, from students to professionals in the field of chemistry.
